# document_classification_with_bert
In this project, you will work on Track 5 of BioCreative VII, namely the LitCovid track on
Multi-label topic classification for COVID-19 literature annotation (https://biocreative.
bioinformatics.udel.edu/tasks/biocreative-vii/track-5/).
The aim of the LitCovid track is to develop a text classification system that will assign an input
scientific article into one or more of the following seven classes: Treatment, Diagnosis, Prevention, Mechanism, Transmission, Epidemic Forecasting, and Case Report. A training set of 24,960
articles and a development set of 6,239 articles manually annotated by human experts are provided at the following link: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/LitCovid/
biocreative/. The training data is included in the BC7-LitCovid-Train.csv file and the development data is included in the BC7-LitCovid-Dev.csv file. Note that a test set is also provided
(BC7-LitCovid-Test.csv). However, we will NOT be using it, since the labels for the test set are not
available. A readme file including further information about the task and the data sets is available
at the BC7-LitCovid-Readme.pdf file.
Please use the training set for developing (training and tuning your system) and the development data set for evaluation/testing. That is, we will use the development set as a test set. So, you
should NOT use the development set for developing/training/tuning your systems.
You should use the evaluation tool provided at https://github.com/ncbi/biocreative_
litcovid for evaluating the performance of your systems.
In order to design your systems you are suggested to read the prior work on this task. A set of
reference papers is available at https://biocreative.bioinformatics.udel.edu/
tasks/biocreative-vii/track-5/ and the papers of the shared task participants presented at the BioCreative VII Workshop are available at https://biocreative.bioinformatics.
